## Daily auto-updates

A GitHub Action runs at **06:00 UTC** every day and commits a digest to `feeds/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:
- Security news — SANS ISC, The Hacker News, Schneier on Security, PortSwigger Research
- Critical CVEs from NVD
- New tool releases — KitPloit, GitHub trending security repos

## Submit a resource

[→ Open a resource submission issue](https://github.com/bb1nfosec/Information-Security-Tasks/issues/new?template=submit-resource.yml)

Fill in the form — the bot reads it, appends your link to the right category file under `resources/`, and closes the issue automatically.

## Token-optimized for LLM sessions

Scanned and optimized with [`distill-llm`](https://github.com/bb1nfosec/Distill):

```
Before  2.9M tokens  $8.84/session  (1473% of Claude context)
After    176k tokens  $0.53/session  (88% of context)
```

```sh
pip install distill-llm && distill scan --path .
```
